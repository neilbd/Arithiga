# Arithiga_VisuallyImpaired

Arithiga is a variation of the game Galaga where you shoot a series of numbers and operators to get the given number at the top
of the screen. The numbers used range from 1-9 and the given operators are +, -, *, /, and ^ (representing addition, subtraction,
multiplcation, division, and the power symbol, respectively). You get 100 points for getting the number using 1 or 2 operators, 50 for using 3-5 operators, and 25 for any number
of operators using afterwards. For instance, if the given number is 8, you get more points for shooting 4, +, then 4 
than 2, +, 2, +, 2, +, then 2. This accumulated number also carries over to the next given number. If the next number happens to 
be 24, the player starts out with 8 from the previous number.

The player has three lives. Each life is reduced when the ship is hit by a number or operator symbol. For every hit, the
number accumulated up to that point turns back to 0. Once all three lives are gone, the game ends.

This version of the game allows customization options for your the type of ship used, the font and color of the numbers, and
the type and color of laser used, and more. The player presses the left and right arrow keys to move the ship between
the numbers and operators on the screen. The numbers appear first. Once a number is hit, the operators appear on the screen,
followed by the numbers once an operator is hit, and so on. To shoot, the player presses the space button.

This version of Arithiga is designed for those with visual impairments. As a result, the game has a speech feature where a voice
tells the player the number to get, the current number and points the user has accumulated, and what number or operator
the user is selecting.
